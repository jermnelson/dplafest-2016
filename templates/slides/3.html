        <h3>What is Redis?</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
         Redis, short for <strong>RE</strong>mote <strong>DI</strong>ctionary <strong>S</strong>erver, is an in-memory
         key-value data storage server and is one of the  most popular No-SQL technologies. Started and still actively  
         maintained by Salvatore Sanfilippo, Redis use as sophisticated "glue" technology powers solutions across both
         start-ups and established technology companies such as Twitter, Slack, Medium, and Cisco.

        <p>Redis real power comes from the rich set of operations you can perform on different data structures 
        like lists, sets, hashes, sorted sets, and other more exotic data types.
