<h2 class="mx2">Redis Key Schema</h2>
<p class="mx2" style="font-size: 1.2em">
    Because of the flexibility of Redis key (any characters up to a maximum size 
    of 512 megabytes) a recommendation is to structure the relationships in the 
    names and delimiters with the keys that are used in an application This
    is called a key schema. The key schema used in the Linked Data Structure format
    is relatively simple and is inspired by a technique for calling Lua server-side
    scripts in Redis.

        <h3>Lua Scripting in Redis</h3>
	<p>Redis offers server-side scripts using the Lua programming language.
        You can load the script once and a SHA1 hash digest of the script is returned 
	that then in subsequent function calls instead of sending 
	the entire script over the network each time you want to 
	execute the function, you use the SHA1 and any arguments</p>

        <p>The design of the Linked-Data Fragment Server Redis LRU Cache shamelessly copies Redis 
        in representing triples in the cache. Much like how the SHA1 of a Lua Script is used to 
        execute server-side code in Redis; in this project all subjects, predicates,
        and objects are stored as string values using the SHA1 hash of the value as the Redis key.

    <h3>Subjects, Predicates, and Objects as SHA1s</h3>
    <p>In this application's key schema, the SHA1 of each subject, predicate, and 
    object is calculated and
    then used those SHA1s are used in representing the triple relationship in various ways
    in the triplestore. There are advantages and disadvantages to this approach, the advantages 
    are that all urls, literals, and blank-nodes are normalized to set size and can be 
    calculated independently from Redis. Some disadvantages are that looking at the keys doesn't
    tell you anything about the value the SHA1 was generated from (often in Redis application 
    design the key relates information about the value store and relationships with other keys)
    and another disadvantage is that even for a single character literal, we will store 40 
    characters as the key.</p>
